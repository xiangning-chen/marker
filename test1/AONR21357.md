A. The value of RqJA is measured with the device mounted on 1in2 FR-4 board with 2oz. Copper, in a still air environment with T A =25°C. The Power dissipation PDSM is based on R qJA t≤ 10s and the maximum allowed junction temperature of 150°C. The value in any given application depends on the user's specific board design.

B. The power dissipation PD is based on TJ(MAX)=150°C, using junction-to-case thermal resistance, and is more useful in setting the upper dissipation limit for cases where additional heatsinking is used. 

C. Single pulse width limited by junction temperature TJ(MAX)=150°C.

D. The RqJA is the sum of the thermal impedance from junction to case RqJC and case to ambient.

E. The static characteristics in Figures 1 to 6 are obtained using <300ms pulses, duty cycle 0.5% max.

F. These curves are based on the junction-to-case thermal impedance which is measured with the device mounted to a large heatsink, assuming a maximum junction temperature of TJ(MAX)=150°C. The SOA curve provides a single pulse rating. 

G. The maximum current rating is package limited. 

H. These tests are performed with the device mounted on 1 in2 FR-4 board with 2oz. Copper, in a still air environment with TA=25°C.
