## 3 Description

The TPS53688 is a fully VR13.HC SVID compliant step-down controller with two channels, built-in nonvolatile memory (NVM), and PMBus™ interface, and is fully compatible with TI NexFET™ smart power stages. Advanced control features such as the D-CAP
+™ architecture with undershoot reduction (USR)
provide fast transient response, low output capacitance, and good dynamic current sharing. The device also provides a novel phase interleaving strategy and dynamic phase shedding, for efficiency improvement across loading conditions. Adjustable control of output voltage slew rate and adaptive voltage positioning are natively supported. In addition, the device supports the PMBus communication interface, for reporting the telemetry of voltage, current, power, temperature, and fault conditions to the host system. All programmable parameters can be configured through the PMBus interface and stored in NVM as new default values, to minimize the external component count. The TPS53688 device is offered in a thermally enhanced 40-pin QFN packaged and is rated to operate from –40°C to 125°C.
